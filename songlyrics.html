		<h4>PIERCE THE VEIL</H4>
		<hr/>

		<p>
		Sunshine, there ain't a thing that you can do <br/>
		that's gonna ruin my night <br/>
		this dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy <br/>
		licking your fingers like you're done </p>
		
		<p>You've decided there is so much more than me<br/>
		and baby honestly it's harder breathing next to you<br/>
		I shake, I brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me<br/>
		Hold my heart it's beating for you anyway
		</p>
		
		<p>What if I can't forget you?<br/>
		I'll burn your name into my throat<br/>
		I'll be the fire that'll catch you<br/>
		What's so good about picking up the pieces?<br/>
		None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
		</p>
		
		<p>Nobody prays for the heartless<br/>
		Nobody gives another penny for the selfish<br/>
		Don't mind me, I'm just reaching for your necklace<br/>
		Talking to my mom about this little girl from Texas
		</p>
		
		
		<p>What if I can't forget you?<br/>
		I'll burn your name into my throat<br/>
		I'll be the fire that'll catch you<br/>
		What's so good about picking up the pieces?<br/>
		None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
		</p>
		
		<p> You just give her back to me <br/>
		You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need<br/>
		So, baby hat if I can't forget you?<br/>
		Collide invisible lips like a shadow on the wall<br/>
		and just throw, no You can't just throw me away!
		</p>
		
		<p>What if I can't forget you?<br/>
		I'll burn your name into my throat<br/>
		I'll be the fire that'll catch you<br/>
		What's so good about picking up the pieces?<br/>
		What if I don't even want to
		</p>
		
		<p>What if I can't forget you?<br/>
		I'll burn your name into my throat<br/>
		I'll be the fire that'll catch you<br/>
		What's so good about picking up the pieces?<br/>
		None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
		</p>
		
		<p> Just give her back to me<br/>
		You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need<br/>
		So, baby what if I can't forget you?<br/>
		I'd better learn to live alone
		</p>
		
		<p> What's so good about picking up the pieces?<br/>
		What's so good about<br/>
		What's so good about<br/>
		What's so good about picking up the pieces?
		</p>

			<p>
			My name is Ina Rose Bondoc, my friends usually call me Rose or Drew, 20 years of age. My mother came up with the name 'Rose'
because the day I was born my cheeks were glowing red. Well, you can't see it now because I'm obviiously a morena.
My elementary friends started calling me 'Drew' for some reason. They told me my name doesn't suit my personality.
I was born in a family with four other siblings and I am one of the three girls. I am the second eldest among my siblings. 
I'm a freshman in college and I'm taking Computer Science. I will be shifting course next school year from comscie to educ
I'm currently living with my mom here in Capas,Tarlac. She's working as a call center agent and my father is from Zambales and he's managing his resort.
I grew up with my mom and my step father

			There are things I love doing during my free time and also helps me cope with stress like: read books, 
write stories and poems, play my guitar, sing and watch documentaries.
I've been a fan of brutal music since I was 12 because it can put me in a calming "wanna go to sleep" mood better than chill music.
There are some few things I'm good at like brewing coffee, cooking, baking, and some people say my tiny hands give the best massage.
I'm also good at playing volleyball and badminton.

			I was clinically diagnosed with clinical depresssion, ADHD and cyclothymic disorder at the age of 13.
I've been taking meds for years now just to feel normal and just so I could sleep.
I've had to study harder and twice as much just to get by with everyone and to get atleast the average
My ADHD gave me a superpower to learn tiny things quickly and making them my habits but I simply cannot do long division.
			</p>
		
			<p>
			I'm naturally a distant person, I was always that weird and geek kid in school from elementary to junior high school.
I was extremely an introvert and i have my own little world. My classmates would say I'm such a loner.
they don't know I chose to be alone, I prefer solitude. I prefer to shut myself out from the entire world.
That's before meeting my coolest extrovert friends. I'm still an introvert but atleast I'm friends with
these coolest and most sublime creature on earth who made my HS life crazy and exciting.
			</p>

			Sometimes, I find myself doubting everthing I'm doing. I lose all the energy and motivation I had.
There are times where I feel like a complete outcast.
There are some days that i feel like  I'm not good at anything.
There are also some days where I want to see myself growing. And between those days I've realized that,
trying something new even when I'm not good at it, it will always make me grow.
There are things I'm slacking in - good habits I want to create and bad habits I want to get rid
and I'm fighting for things like more autonomy in the work I do about my self issues and a lots of baby steps.
I think of myself right now  as a lady in a blindfold just walking where the whisper of my heart takes me.
